## E-commerce Checkout Optimization: A/B Testing Analysis

### 1 Project Introduction
#### 1.1 A/B Testing
A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a powerful method that allows organizations to compare two or more variations of a webpage, app feature, or campaign to determine which performs better. By systematically testing changes with real users, businesses can move beyond assumptions and intuition, by relying on empirical evidence to guide improvements. This not only reduces risk but also optimizes outcomes—boosting conversion rates, user engagement, and overall return on investment. This project analyzes a comprehensive A/B testing experiment conducted on an e-commerce platform to optimize the checkout process. The study examines the impact of design changes on conversion rates, revenue per user, and other metrics.

#### 1.2 Business Problem

The current checkout process has a 38% abandonment rate, costing the company an estimated $1.3M annually lost in revenue. The management want to make changes in this process to boost conversion rate, average order value, and user experience.


## 2 Experimental Design
The current checkout process has four steps, team members want to streamline it to two steps only. Here is the setup for the experiment
### Test Variants:
- **Control (A)**: Original 4-step checkout process
- **Treatment (B)**: Use 2-step checkout process
### Hypothesis:
**H₀**: The new checkout design has no effect on conversion rate  
**H₁**: The new checkout design increases conversion rate by at least 2%
### Experiment parameters:
baseline_conversion = 0.1  # Current conversion rate \
minimum_detectable_effect = 0.02  # 2% absolute increase \
alpha = 0.05  # Significance level \
power = 0.80  # Statistical power

### **Success Metrics**:
- Primary: Conversion rate (purchases/sessions)
- Secondary: Revenue per user, time to checkout completion

### Sample Size Calculation
```python
import scipy.stats as stats
import numpy as np
from statsmodels.stats.power import ttest_power
from statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportions_ztest



# Calculate required sample size
effect_size = minimum_detectable_effect / np.sqrt(baseline_conversion * (1 - baseline_conversion))
sample_size_per_group = stats.norm.ppf(1 - alpha/2)**2 * 2 / effect_size**2
print(f"Required sample size per group: {int(sample_size_per_group):,}")
```

**Sample Size**: 15,680 users per group (31,360 total)  
**Test Duration**: 21 days  
**Traffic Split**: 50/50 randomized assignment

### Randomization & Controls
- **Stratified randomization** by device type (mobile/desktop) and user type (new/returning)
- **Consistent user experience** - users remain in assigned group throughout test period
- **Exclusion criteria**: Users with incomplete session data, bot traffic, employees

## Data Collection & Structure

### Key Metrics Tracked
```python
# Primary metrics
conversion_rate = conversions / total_sessions
revenue_per_user = total_revenue / total_users
average_order_value = total_revenue / total_orders

# Secondary metrics  
time_to_checkout = checkout_completion_time - checkout_start_time
bounce_rate = single_page_sessions / total_sessions
cart_abandonment_rate = (carts_created - orders) / carts_created

# Segmentation variables
device_type = ['mobile', 'desktop', 'tablet']
user_type = ['new_user', 'returning_user']
traffic_source = ['organic', 'paid', 'direct', 'social']
```

### Data Quality Assurance
- **Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) Check**: Verified 50/50 split maintained
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified and handled extreme values (orders >$5,000)
- **Data Validation**: Cross-referenced with payment processor data

## Statistical Analysis

### 1. Primary Metric Analysis

#### Conversion Rate Results
```python
# Conversion rate analysis
control_conversions = 1,847
control_sessions = 15,680
treatment_conversions = 2,156  
treatment_sessions = 15,680

control_rate = control_conversions / control_sessions  # 11.77%
treatment_rate = treatment_conversions / treatment_sessions  # 13.75%

# Statistical significance test
z_stat, p_value = proportions_ztest([treatment_conversions, control_conversions], 
                                  [treatment_sessions, control_sessions])

print(f"Control conversion rate: {control_rate:.3f}")
print(f"Treatment conversion rate: {treatment_rate:.3f}")
print(f"Relative lift: {(treatment_rate/control_rate - 1)*100:.1f}%")
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

**Results**:
- **Control**: 11.77% conversion rate
- **Treatment**: 13.75% conversion rate  
- **Absolute lift**: +1.98 percentage points
- **Relative lift**: +16.8%
- **Statistical significance**: p < 0.001 ✅

#### Revenue Impact Analysis
```python
# Revenue per user analysis
control_rpu = 47.23
treatment_rpu = 52.91

# Bootstrap confidence intervals
def bootstrap_mean_diff(control_data, treatment_data, n_bootstrap=10000):
    bootstrap_diffs = []
    for _ in range(n_bootstrap):
        control_sample = np.random.choice(control_data, size=len(control_data), replace=True)
        treatment_sample = np.random.choice(treatment_data, size=len(treatment_data), replace=True)
        diff = np.mean(treatment_sample) - np.mean(control_sample)
        bootstrap_diffs.append(diff)
    return np.array(bootstrap_diffs)

# Calculate confidence interval for revenue lift
revenue_diff_ci = np.percentile(bootstrap_diffs, [2.5, 97.5])
print(f"Revenue per user lift: ${treatment_rpu - control_rpu:.2f}")
print(f"95% CI: [${revenue_diff_ci[0]:.2f}, ${revenue_diff_ci[1]:.2f}]")
```

**Revenue Results**:
- **Control**: $47.23 revenue per user
- **Treatment**: $52.91 revenue per user
- **Absolute lift**: +$5.68 per user (+12.0%)
- **95% CI**: [$4.12, $7.24]

control_avg_time = 284  # seconds
treatment_avg_time = 198  # seconds
time_reduction = ((control_avg_time - treatment_avg_time) / control_avg_time) * 100

print(f"Average checkout time reduction: {time_reduction:.1f}%")

# Cart abandonment analysis  
control_abandonment = 0.731
treatment_abandonment = 0.654
abandonment_improvement = control_abandonment - treatment_abandonment

print(f"Cart abandonment rate improvement: -{abandonment_improvement:.3f}")
```

**UX Results**:
- **Checkout time**: 30.3% reduction (284s → 198s)
- **Cart abandonment**: 7.7 percentage point improvement
- **User satisfaction**: No significant change (guardrail metric protected)

### 4. Advanced Statistical Techniques

#### Bayesian Analysis
```python
import pymc3 as pm
import arviz as az

# Bayesian A/B test analysis
with pm.Model() as model:
    # Priors
    p_control = pm.Beta('p_control', alpha=1, beta=1)
    p_treatment = pm.Beta('p_treatment', alpha=1, beta=1)
    
    # Likelihood
    obs_control = pm.Binomial('obs_control', n=control_sessions, p=p_control, 
                             observed=control_conversions)
    obs_treatment = pm.Binomial('obs_treatment', n=treatment_sessions, p=p_treatment, 
                               observed=treatment_conversions)
    
    # Derived quantities
    lift = pm.Deterministic('lift', p_treatment - p_control)
    relative_lift = pm.Deterministic('relative_lift', (p_treatment / p_control) - 1)
    
    # Sample from posterior
    trace = pm.sample(5000, tune=1000, return_inferencedata=True)

# Probability that treatment is better
prob_treatment_better = (trace.posterior.lift > 0).sum() / len(trace.posterior.lift.values.flatten())
print(f"Probability treatment > control: {prob_treatment_better:.3f}")
```

**Bayesian Results**:
- **Probability treatment is better**: 99.7%
- **Expected lift**: 1.94% (95% HDI: [1.21%, 2.67%])
- **Risk of launching**: Very low

#### Multiple Testing Correction
```python
from statsmodels.stats.multitest import multipletests

# Multiple hypothesis testing correction
p_values = [0.0003, 0.0089, 0.0421, 0.1847, 0.0156]  # Various metric p-values
metric_names = ['Conversion Rate', 'Revenue per User', 'AOV', 'Bounce Rate', 'Time to Checkout']

# Benjamini-Hochberg correction
rejected, p_adjusted, _, _ = multipletests(p_values, alpha=0.05, method='fdr_bh')

for i, (metric, p_orig, p_adj, significant) in enumerate(zip(metric_names, p_values, p_adjusted, rejected)):
    print(f"{metric}: p={p_orig:.4f}, p_adj={p_adj:.4f}, Significant: {significant}")
```

## Business Impact & ROI

### Financial Impact Projection
```python
# Annual revenue impact calculation
monthly_sessions = 125000
annual_sessions = monthly_sessions * 12

# Revenue impact
baseline_annual_revenue = annual_sessions * control_rate * 85.40  # avg order value
treatment_annual_revenue = annual_sessions * treatment_rate * 85.40

annual_revenue_lift = treatment_annual_revenue - baseline_annual_revenue
print(f"Projected annual revenue lift: ${annual_revenue_lift:,.0f}")

# Implementation costs
development_cost = 45000
ongoing_maintenance = 12000  # annual

roi = (annual_revenue_lift - ongoing_maintenance) / development_cost
print(f"First-year ROI: {roi:.1f}x")
```

**Financial Results**:
- **Projected annual revenue lift**: $2,387,000
